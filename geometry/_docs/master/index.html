# Do not edit this configuration. The purpose of this page is to create an index
# in the /docs URL by specifying an index.html file.
permalink: /docs/index.html   # allows users to access the URL without specifying a page since most servers check for an index.html file first
index: true           # lets Jekyll know when the user is using this page and tells Jekyll to check for an index doc to use as the index for the URL. Jekyll identifies what doc to use because the index doc is specified by the scalar value `index: true` in the front matter of the file.
